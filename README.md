## Lab 18 – Wireless Networking Attack & Mitigation Techniques

In this lab, I worked with Wireshark and other wireless security tools to understand how data travels across a network and how attackers can capture it. I learned how to extract images and ZIP files from unencrypted traffic, analyze plain-text FTP credentials, and decrypt both WEP and WPA captures using aircrack-ng. This helped me see the difference between weak and strong wireless security, and why encryption is so important.

I also ran into several real-world troubleshooting moments, which helped me grow. Some commands failed the first time, I had permission issues, and I had to learn to switch between the correct virtual machines. I even had to correct the fork bomb syntax multiple times before it finally ran. These struggles taught me patience, attention to detail, and how to work through errors instead of getting stuck. Overall, this lab strengthened my understanding of wireless attacks and gave me hands-on experience solving problems under pressure.
